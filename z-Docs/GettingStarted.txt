### INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW DEVELOPERS ###

1. Download and Install XAMP (Default Settings for installation works)

1.5 I HIGHLY reccommend to uninstall and reinstall XAMPP even if you already
have XAMPP on your local machine since this has been an issue before

2 Open XAMPP and run Apache and MySQL

2.5 If MySQL is not starting (shutting down unexpectedly) use this link to help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18022809/how-to-solve-error-mysql-shutdown-unexpectedly OR THIS video if error 'invalid settings' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjYxxYlXkOs
