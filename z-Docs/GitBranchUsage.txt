Git Branch usage for CM 

Create Private Branch:  
    1. git checkout master 

    2. git pull 
    
    3. git checkout -b <YourBranchName>
    
    4. git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master <YourBranchName>

Make Changes to Private Branch, Then Commit: 
    1. git checkout <YourBranchName>
        - NOTE: only do this step if you are not already on <YourBranchName>
        - a quick way to check which branch you are on is: git status 

    2. git pull 
    
    3. git add <filename>
        - you must do the above step for each file you changed 
    
    4. git commit -m "your comments"
    
    5. git push origin <YourBranchName>

Add Changes to Master Branch 
    - You can do this two ways
    
    1. You can make a pull request on github and if the branch can be automatically merged, then it will be "highlighted green". Wait for reviewers to approve merge request 

    2. If your changes can't be merged automatically aka you have merge conflicts, then do the following in git terminal.
        
        2.1 git checkout <YourBranchName>
        2.2 git pull 
        2.3 git checkout master 
        2.4 git pull 
        2.5 git merge --squash <YourBranchName>
            (Resolve Any conflicts, do 'git add' on conflicted files after resolving conflicts)
        2.6 git commit -m "Your comments"
        2.7 git push origin master
